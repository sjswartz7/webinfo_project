                "Agatha Christie did not write many stories in which business and commerce took centre stage. Yet in those she did write, for all her Tory leanings, she repeatedly chose to make capitalist enterprise a focus for criminality, numbering tycoons and businesses amongst her perpetrators of robbery, embezzlement and murder. Their inclusion as law-breakers should serve to temper the reputation of Christie as stalwart of the social and economic status quo. Rather than whitewash the private sector she strove to capture the spirit of the age. She wanted her novels to be true to life and grounded in the real world. She therefore drew on the reality that was readily apparent from the time in which she lived. Christie’s novels involving the world of business thereby provide a precious insight into her era: particularly in the case of her inter-war novels they exemplify the critical stance of a society in which the public perceived serious alternatives to capitalism. Her post-war works reflected a more collectivist age by featuring businesses as criminal conspiracies. Consistently in these dystopias, the veneer of capitalist integrity – be it of Bertram’s Hotel, Anthony Blunt or financiers generally – turns out to be illusory. In the Christie universe, everything is unsettling and dangerous: the capitalist system is no exception."

                It’s common to read Christie for its ability to serve as an escape. For one thing there are the pleasures of Christie’s settings―those tranquil villages, exciting archeological sites, and luxurious trains. Her books are a leisured-class fantasy, replete with abundant servants, stately homes, and harmonious (though vastly unequal) social relations. This fantasy world rests, in large part, on her main characters not needing to struggle for money…although this doesn’t mean that her characters don’t think about money. In fact these well-off people often don’t consider themselves well-off, or are plotting to make themselves better-off. This is a major plot point in many Christie works, such as those where young people greedily anticipate an aged relative’s inheritance, and thus have a motive for speeding along the death of said relative.

                Much of Christie’s work seeks to bolster the rigid class system. For one thing, there’s the treatment of the working class. Servants and service employees are almost invariably vapid, as if suggesting that their natural place in the social order is a lesser one. There’s the “somewhat bone-headed page-boy addicted to cheap crime stories” of One, Two, Buckle My Shoe or the “half-witted but amiable” domestic servant of The Moving Finger. In The Mirror Crack’d from Side to Side, one character sums up a group of maids: “Rather simple, some of them had been, and frequently adenoidal, and Amy distinctly moronic.”

                    Christie never really renovated her ideas about colonised, or increasingly ex-colonised, peoples. Sure, she started acknowledging their political aspirations but, as 1955’s Hickory Dickory Dock makes clear, she still didn’t think much of them. Caribbean, African and Indian figures were castigated, pitched as unstable, stupid or dangerous. But another striking facet of her postwar output was that all of a sudden, murderers with imperial connections and who were of British descent started showing up in her works. Rakes, dangerous men, immoral men, who had worked as farmers in East Africa, who had interests in mining in West Africa, or who had lived in Canada, or Australia.

                <p>
                    Why was this? Christie was evidently making a point about morality, or the decline of it. Empire was no longer full of stout upstanding individuals, but dangerous types. Christie was so sure that empire couldn’t have been seriously challenged by her ragtag of indigenous upstarts that she had a distinctly Anglocentric view of imperial decline. Decline was happening because Britons no longer upheld old prewar ways. Something had gone, and for Christie, it was the replacement of a collective imperial spirit with a postwar left-wing ethos that led young men to pooh-pooh this supposedly noble endeavour.

                    Christie’s female characters are diverse, dominant, swashbuckling and violently active and, at a time when women were still seen as second-class citizens, Christie’s portrayals are determinedly and deliberately egalitarian in relation to gender. Focus on Christie as the ‘mistress of plotting’, ingenious at concealing the murderer, which has concentrated analysis on the ending rather than the process of the novel as a whole, alongside crime criticism’s fetishisation of the detective to the detriment of all other characterisations, has prevented a true celebration of Christie’s fiction’s intervention in the representation of gender formations and expectations from 1920 to the early 1970s

                    Through the character of Miss Marple, Christie has fun with the “old woman” stereotype, creating it and then shattering it over and over again, revealing to the reader their own ageist tendencies. Portrayed as a busybody and gossip by her fellow villagers, Miss Marple is truly the crone: an independent woman, one who knows the community thoroughly and understands human behavior and motivation.

                        It’s no secret that Agatha Christie’s career as a mystery novelist began with the First World War. The Mysterious Affair at Styles was written at the close of the war, and Hercule Poirot made his debut there as one of the numerous Belgian refugees seeking asylum in England during the war. Christie herself had served as a volunteer nurse, dispensing medications, and this experience becomes visible in her use of poisons in multiple books afterward. What is perhaps a little less obvious is the way in which the war’s negative impact on society appears in her work. Part of this absence might have to do with familiarity; generally, you have no need to draw attention to something when your audience is intimately familiar with it. It might also reflect a distaste for unpleasantness; as a form of escapist literature, the whole point of the mystery story was to put the harsher realities of the post-war world aside and lose oneself in something a little more positive.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Among Christie’s works, the most obvious reference to the impact of the First World War must be The ABC Murders, which, very early on, begins to set up a shell-shocked veteran, Alexander Cust, as the prime suspect in a spate of serial killings. She describes him as someone with an ineffectual personality, weak-willed, and prone to suggestion. We also know he’d received a head injury during the war and has suffered from frequent headaches ever since. Because of difficulties stemming from his trauma, he’s had difficulty holding down a job, though he has recently found employment selling stockings door-to-door.
